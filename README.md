# Ping-Pong-Game-
Ping Pong, or table tennis, is a fast-paced indoor sport for two or four players. Played on a rectangular table split by a net, players use paddles to hit a lightweight plastic ball back and forth. The goal is to make the ball bounce once on the opponentâ€™s side in a way that they cannot return it, scoring points to win the game.
