# Ping-Pong-Game-
Ping Pong, or table tennis, is a fast-paced indoor sport for two or four players. Played on a rectangular table split by a net, players use paddles to hit a lightweight plastic ball back and forth. The goal is to make the ball bounce once on the opponent’s side in a way that they cannot return it, scoring points to win the game.
Key Features:
Table: The standard size is 9 feet long, 5 feet wide, and 30 inches high.
Net: The net is 6 inches high and stretches across the middle of the table.
Ball: The ball is usually made of plastic, weighs 2.7 grams, and has a diameter of 40 mm.
Paddles: The paddles have a wooden core covered by rubber and come in various textures and grips to allow for different styles of play.
Rules:
Scoring: A game typically goes to 11 points, with players alternating serves every two points. A player must win by at least two points.
Service: The ball must be tossed at least 6 inches into the air and struck so it bounces once on the server’s side before crossing the net.
Play: Players take turns hitting the ball after it bounces on their side of the table. Points are scored when one player fails to return the ball within the rules.
Objective:
The main goal is to outscore the opponent by making shots that are difficult for them to return, while adhering to the rules of the game.

Styles of Play:
Offensive (Attacking): Emphasizes aggressive, fast shots like smashes and loops.
Defensive: Involves blocking and countering, waiting for the opponent to make a mistake.
Ping Pong is known for its speed and requires excellent reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and strategic thinking. It is an Olympic sport and is played both casually and competitively worldwide.
